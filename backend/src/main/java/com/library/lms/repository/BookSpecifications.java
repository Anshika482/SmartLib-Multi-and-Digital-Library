/**
 * Reusable query fragments for finding books.
 *
 * <p>A {@link Specification} is one piece of a WHERE clause, built with the JPA
 * Criteria API instead of a method name. Pieces combine with {@code and} /
 * {@code or}, and Spring Data turns the result into a single SQL statement -
 * so filtering, counting and paging all still happen in the database.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why not derived query methods.</b> The condition this API needs is</p>
 *
 * <pre>category = ? AND (title LIKE ? OR author LIKE ? OR isbn LIKE ?)</pre>
 *
 * <p>and a derived method name cannot express those brackets - Spring Data
 * binds {@code And} more tightly than {@code Or}, so
 * {@code findByCategoryIdAndTitleContainingOrAuthorContaining} actually means
 * {@code (category AND title) OR author}, which is wrong and silently so. The
 * only way to fix it with derived queries is to repeat the category on every
 * branch, giving an unreadable method name that grows worse with each new
 * filter. Specifications keep the grouping explicit and each filter separate.</p>
 *
 * <p>The class is final with a private constructor because it is a holder for
 * static factory methods; there is nothing to instantiate.</p>
