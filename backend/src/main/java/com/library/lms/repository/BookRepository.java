 * write a class that implements it. At startup Spring Data JPA finds this
 * interface, generates a proxy class in memory and registers it as a bean, so
 * the service layer can simply inject a {@code BookRepository} and call these
 * methods.</p>
 *
 * <p>Extending {@code JpaRepository<Book, Long>} - where {@code Book} is the
 * entity and {@code Long} is the type of its {@code @Id} - already provides
 * {@code save()}, {@code findById()}, {@code findAll()}, {@code deleteById()},
 * {@code count()} and paging/sorting support for free. Only the two queries
 * below are specific to this project.</p>
 */
/**
 * <p>It also extends {@code JpaSpecificationExecutor}, which adds
