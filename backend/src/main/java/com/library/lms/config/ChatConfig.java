/**
 * Chooses which assistant answers questions.
 *
 * <p>One bean, picked from {@code chat.provider}:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code scripted} - the default: keyword-matched answers from a fixed
 *       script, no provider, no network call and no key. Development and the
 *       tests run on this, so CI needs no credential and no request ever leaves
 *       the machine.</li>
 *   <li>{@code gemini} - Gemini, through Google's Gen AI SDK, with the key from
 *       {@code GEMINI_API_KEY}.</li>
 *   <li>{@code anthropic} - Claude, through the official SDK, with the key from
 *       {@code ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}. Kept so a deployment can be moved back to it
 *       by changing one setting.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Each provider reads its own key.</b> Naming one and setting the other's
 * key stops startup, rather than starting an instance that answers every
 * question with a 503 because it is holding a credential for somewhere else.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>An unknown name stops startup</b> rather than falling back. A typo in
 * the provider must not leave a deployment quietly answering with the script
 * while everyone believes an assistant is running.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Naming the provider without a key also stops startup.</b> An assistant
 * that cannot reach its provider answers every question with a 503, which is
 * worse than being told at deploy time that the key is missing.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The key is read here and goes straight into the SDK client.</b> It is
 * never logged, never stored, never returned and never held anywhere this
 * application can reach it again - the startup line below says whether a key is
 * present, never what it is.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Timeouts are explicit.</b> The SDK's own default is ten minutes, which
 * is far too long for a request a member is waiting on: a provider that stops
 * answering would hold the request thread until it gave up. These bound it.</p>
