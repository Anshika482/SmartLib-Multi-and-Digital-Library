    /**
     * Defines the single filter chain every request passes through.

     * <p>Declaring this bean is what makes Spring Boot stand down. Its
     * {@code SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration} installs the default
     * username-and-password chain only when no {@link SecurityFilterChain} bean
     * of our own exists, so this method replaces that default outright.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Accounts come from the database.</b> Spring Boot would otherwise
     * create a throwaway in memory user and log a generated password at
     * startup. That comes from {@code UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration},
     * which backs off as soon as a UserDetailsService bean exists, and this
     * application supplies one that reads the users table. The default account
     * is no longer created: a test run reports zero generated password lines
     * and no InMemoryUserDetailsManager, so the database is the only source of
     * accounts.</p>
     *
     * <p>Authorization is now two rules rather than one blanket allowance.
     * See the list below.</p>
     *
     * <p>Each setting, and why:</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>CSRF disabled</b> - cross site request forgery protection works
     *       by issuing a token to a server rendered form and checking it comes
     *       back. There are no forms here, and a stateless REST client cannot
     *       hold that token, so the check would reject every POST, PUT and
     *       DELETE while protecting nothing.</li>
     *   <li><b>Form login disabled</b> - the default chain redirects
     *       unauthenticated callers to an HTML login page. An API client wants
     *       a status code, not a page of markup.</li>
     *   <li><b>HTTP Basic disabled</b> - this project will authenticate with
     *       JWT later. Leaving Basic enabled would keep a second, weaker way in
     *       that nobody intends to use.</li>
     *   <li><b>Login public, writes restricted, everything else
     *       authenticated</b> - the public auth matchers name one method and
     *       exact paths, so only {@code POST} on login, refresh and logout is
     *       open; refresh and logout carry their own credential, the refresh
     *       token, because the access token may already have expired. A
     *       pattern such as {@code /api/auth/**} would have been shorter and
     *       would have quietly exposed every future route under that prefix,
     *       which is how a password reset endpoint ends up public by
     *       accident.</li>
     *   <li><b>Creating, editing and deleting</b> books and categories, and
     *       issuing or returning a book, require ADMIN or LIBRARIAN. Reading
     *       any of them requires only authentication, so a member can browse
     *       the catalogue and see loans without being able to change
     *       anything. Rules are declared specific first and the catch-all
     *       last, because the first match wins: putting
     *       {@code anyRequest()} earlier would swallow every rule after
     *       it.</li>
     *   <li><b>401 for unauthenticated callers</b> - with form login and
     *       HTTP Basic both off, Spring Security has no entry point of its
     *       own and falls back to {@code Http403ForbiddenEntryPoint}, which
     *       answers an empty 403. That is the wrong signal: 403 means "you
     *       are known and still may not", while these callers simply sent no
     *       credentials. See {@link #restAuthenticationEntryPoint}.</li>
     *   <li><b>403 for authenticated callers without the role</b> - a
     *       caller who presented a valid token but lacks the authority an
     *       endpoint demands. Left to Spring Security's default handler this
     *       was a 403 with no body and no content type, so the filter chain
     *       answered in a different shape from every controller. See
     *       {@link RestAccessDeniedHandler}.</li>
     *   <li><b>Health probes public</b> - {@code GET} on the health, liveness,
     *       readiness and info paths needs no token, because a load balancer or
     *       orchestrator has none. Only those exact paths and only GET: every
     *       other actuator path falls to the catch-all, and Actuator exposes
     *       nothing else in any case. The responses carry a status and nothing
     *       more - see application.properties.</li>
     *   <li><b>CORS answered first</b> - {@link CorsConfig} decides which other
     *       sites a browser may call this API from. Its filter sits ahead of
     *       authentication, so a browser's preflight, which never carries a
     *       token, is answered instead of refused with a 401, and a request from
     *       an origin that is not listed is refused before any token is read.
     *       See {@link RestCorsProcessor}.</li>
     *   <li><b>JWT filter inserted</b> - {@link JwtAuthenticationFilter} runs
     *       ahead of {@link UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter}, the slot
     *       Spring Security reserves for whatever establishes identity. It
     *       reads a Bearer token and populates the security context, so a
     *       later authorization rule has something to judge. Placing it after
     *       that point would leave the context empty at the moment the
     *       decision is made.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param http                    the builder Spring Security hands us
     *                               to describe the chain

     * SHA-256 is designed to be fast, which is exactly the wrong property for a
     * password: it lets an attacker who steals the table try billions of
     * guesses per second. BCrypt is designed to be slow and takes a cost factor
     * that can be raised as hardware improves, so the same stored hash stays
     * expensive to attack years later. It also salts each password
     * automatically, so two users who pick the same password still get
     * different hashes and neither can be spotted by comparing rows.</p>
     *
     * <p>The existing rows in the users table already hold BCrypt hashes, and
     * this encoder reads back what is already there: the version and cost
     * factor live inside the hash string itself, so verification uses the
     * parameters each hash was created with rather than the ones configured
     * here. The no argument constructor is the current default strength and is
     * used for anything hashed from now on.</p>
     *

     * and registration work in later steps has one encoder to inject rather
