/**
 * Business logic for managing books.

 * to read and write rows; the controller knows only how to translate HTTP into
 * Java calls. Everything in between - the rules about what counts as valid,
 * what happens when a book is missing, which fields an update is allowed to
 * touch - lives here.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since the DTOs were introduced, this layer is also the <b>boundary</b>
 * between the two worlds. It accepts {@link BookRequest} objects from the web
 * side and answers with {@link BookResponse} objects, while {@link Book}, the
 * entity, never leaves this class. That is the point of the DTOs: the shape of
 * the database table and the shape of the API can now change independently.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code @Service} marks the class as a Spring bean so it is created once at
 * startup and can be injected wherever it is needed.</p>
