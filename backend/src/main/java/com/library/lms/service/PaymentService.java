/**
 * Paying a fine through a payment provider.
 *
 * <p><b>The fine moves only after the server has verified the provider's
 * answer.</b> A client that says a payment succeeded is not believed: the
 * signature is recomputed here, with a secret the client does not hold, over
 * the two references the provider returned. Only then is the fine marked paid,
 * and only then does a {@code FINE_PAID} audit event exist. Everything a caller
 * sends is otherwise treated as a claim.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The desk flow is untouched.</b> {@code TransactionService.recordFinePayment}
 * is still how staff record a fine paid in cash, with the same rules and the
 * same answers. This class is a second way to the same end state, for the
 * member who owes the fine, and it enforces the same three conditions - the
 * book is back, the fine is owed, and it has not been paid - answering with the
 * same {@link FinePaymentNotAllowedException} so a client cannot tell the two
 * routes apart by their errors.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Who may pay.</b> The member the loan belongs to, and the staff of the
 * library it belongs to. The filter chain requires a signed-in caller; the rule
 * about <i>whose</i> loan it is lives here, because only this layer knows. A
 * loan of another library is not found at all, exactly as elsewhere.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Paying twice is impossible in three places.</b> The fine's own state
 * refuses a second payment; a loan that already has a succeeded payment refuses
 * another; and the provider's references are unique in the database, so even a
 * replayed request that got past both would fail to insert. A replay of the
 * <i>same</i> verified payment is answered with the same result and changes
 * nothing - no second fine payment, no second audit event.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>No card data reaches this class</b>, by construction: the provider
 * takes the card on its own pages, and the only fields here are its two
 * references and a signature.</p>
