/**
 * Business logic for borrowing and returning books.
 *
 * <p>Issuing, returning and read-only lookups are implemented, with overdue
 * detection and fines. <b>Whether a loan is overdue is worked out, not
 * stored.</b> An open loan is reported OVERDUE, with the fine it has run up so
 * far, from the day after its due date - on every read, from the due date and
 * today's date - so it is right the moment a due date passes, without anything
 * having to run first, and no read ever writes. Only {@link #returnBook} stores
 * a fine: the amount owed on the day the book came back, which is then what is
 * reported however much later the loan is looked at. The rule, the rate and the
 * date all come from {@link OverduePolicy}.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Paying a fine is recorded, not processed.</b> There is no payment
 * gateway, so {@link #recordFinePayment} stores a member of staff's statement
 * that a fine was paid - which is why only staff may make it, only for a loan in
 * their own library, only once, and only after the book is back and the fine has
 * stopped growing.</p>
 *
 * <p>Constructor injection with final fields, exactly as {@link BookService}
 * and {@link CategoryService} do.</p>
 *
 * <p>Every method here is scoped to one library - the caller's own, resolved
 * from the authenticated login name by {@link #authenticatedUser}. No method
 * accepts a library from the client, and no transaction lookup in this class is
 * unscoped, so a caller can neither read nor alter another library's loans.
 * Role and ownership rules still apply <i>within</i> that library and are
 * unchanged: the tenant boundary sits underneath them, not instead of them.</p>

     *

     * so a loan in another library is not found - the same 404 as an id that
     * does not exist - and nothing about it is read or written.</p>
