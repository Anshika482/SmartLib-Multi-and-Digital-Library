     * <p><b>No administrator can shut themselves out.</b> This endpoint is the
     * only way back from a disabled or locked account, and it needs an
     * administrator who can still log in; in a library with one administrator,
     * disabling your own account would leave nobody able to undo it. So a
     * request that would disable or lock the caller's own account is refused,
     * before either switch is set - a refused request changes nothing, including
     * a switch it was allowed to move. Enabling or unlocking your own account, or
     * sending neither, stays allowed: none of those can lock anyone out. Other
     * accounts in the library, other administrators included, are unaffected.</p>
