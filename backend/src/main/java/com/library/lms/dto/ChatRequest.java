/**
 * One question for the assistant.

 * <p><b>One field, and it is the only thing a caller may send.</b> There is no
 * library, no user id and no role here: an answer is scoped by the account the
 * request is authenticated as, so a caller cannot ask on another library's
 * behalf by adding a field.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Bounded.</b> A question is a line or two; a thousand characters is
 * generous for that and small enough that nothing outsized reaches a provider,
 * or a log, later.</p>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately no {@code toString()}: a question is whatever the caller
 * typed, and the object should not make it easy to write that down.</p>
