/**
 * What the API sends back to a client describing a book.
 *
 * <p>The counterpart to {@link BookRequest}. Where the request is what comes
 * in, this is what goes out, and the difference between them is deliberate:
 * this one carries the {@code id}, because by the time a book is being returned
 * the database has assigned one.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are no validation annotations here, and that is correct - validation
 * guards data arriving from outside. Anything we send has already come from our
 * own database, so there is nothing to check.</p>
 *
 * <p>The reason for returning this instead of the entity is control: the
 * response stays stable even if the Book entity later grows fields we would
 * rather not publish. Switching the controller over to it is a later step.</p>
