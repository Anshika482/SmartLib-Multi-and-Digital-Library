/**
 * What the API sends back describing one borrowing.
 *
 * <p>The book and the user appear as <b>ids only</b>. That is the point of the
 * DTO: returning the Transaction entity would drag its {@code Book} and
 * {@code User} along with it, and the User carries a BCrypt password hash, an
 * email and a role. None of that belongs in a response about a loan, and it
 * would be published by accident rather than by decision. A client that wants
 * the book's details can ask {@code /api/books/{id}}.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code returnDate} and {@code fineAmount} are included even though they are
 * null for a freshly issued book, so the same response shape describes a loan
 * at every stage of its life. {@code status} and {@code fineAmount} describe the
 * loan as it stands on the day of the request: an open loan past its due date
 * is OVERDUE with the fine it has run up so far, and a returned loan carries
 * the fine fixed when it came back.</p>
 *
 * <p>Output only, and it holds no entity. {@link TransactionStatus} is an enum
 * rather than an entity, so exposing it publishes a fixed vocabulary
 * ("ISSUED", "RETURNED", "OVERDUE") and no database structure.</p>
