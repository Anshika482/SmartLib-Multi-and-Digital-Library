/**
 * A single book title held by the library.
 *
 * <p>This class is an <b>entity</b>: one Java object here corresponds to one row
 * in the {@code books} table. Because {@code spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update}
 * is set in application.properties, Hibernate reads the annotations below and
 * creates (or alters) that table for us the next time the application starts -
 * we never have to write CREATE TABLE by hand.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Copies vs. availability.</b> {@code totalCopies} is how many physical
 * copies the library owns; {@code availableCopies} is how many are currently on
 * the shelf rather than borrowed. Keeping both lets us answer "can this be
 * issued?" with a single field check. The borrowing logic that decrements
 * {@code availableCopies} belongs in the service layer, not here.</p>

     * The shelf this book sits on.

     * <p>{@code @ManyToOne} says many books point at one category, which is
     * exactly the real-world relationship. {@code @JoinColumn} names the column
     * that holds the link: {@code category_id}, a foreign key into
     * {@code categories(id)}, replacing the old free-text {@code category}
     * column.</p>
     *
     * <p>The column stays <b>nullable</b> because a category was optional
     * before and must remain so - books that predate this change have no
     * category_id yet, and a NOT NULL constraint would make them invalid rows.</p>
     *
     * <p>Fetching is <b>LAZY</b>, and that is only safe because of how it is
     * read. {@code BookService.toResponse} needs the category's <i>name</i>, not
     * just its id - and a name cannot be served from an uninitialised proxy the
     * way an id can. With {@code spring.jpa.open-in-view=false} the book is
     * already detached by then, so a bare lazy association would throw.</p>
     *
     * <p>What makes it work is that every query feeding {@code toResponse}
     * carries {@code @EntityGraph(attributePaths = "category")}, which loads the
     * category in the same statement rather than one extra select per row. That
     * is the point of the change: EAGER fetched the category correctly but a row
     * at a time, so a fifty-book page cost up to fifty extra queries.</p>
     *
     * <p>The pairing is load-bearing in both directions. A query that returns a
     * Book to {@code toResponse} <b>must</b> declare the graph; the one query
     * that deliberately does not - {@code findByIsbnAndLibraryId}, whose result
     * is only ever compared by id - must not, since fetching there would be
     * waste. {@code BookServiceDetachedCategoryMappingTest} exercises all four
     * graphed paths against a real session and fails if either half is dropped.</p>

     * one, a caller from one library will not be able to read, edit or delete
     * another library's stock, because every query will be scoped by this value
     * rather than by an id the caller supplied.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Required.</b> The column arrived nullable because a NOT NULL column
     * with no default cannot be added to a populated table under
     * {@code STRICT_TRANS_TABLES}; the 25 existing rows were then backfilled to
     * the default library and the column tightened. Both sides now agree that
     * every book belongs to a library.</p>
     *
     * <p>{@code optional = false} as well as {@code nullable = false}: the
     * {@code @JoinColumn} setting describes the column, while {@code optional}
     * tells Hibernate the association is always present, so it can plan an inner
     * join and reject a book with no library before the statement reaches the
     * database rather than after it returns as a constraint violation.</p>
     *
     * <p>{@code LAZY}, unlike the EAGER {@link Category} above, and the
     * difference is deliberate. The category is read on every response to supply
     * its name; the library is not part of any response, so fetching it with
     * each book would be work nothing consumes.</p>
     *
     * <p>{@code @ToString.Exclude} because with {@code open-in-view=false} the
     * session closes at the end of the service layer, so a {@code toString()} on

     * initialise it from and throw. A log line should never fail a request.</p>
