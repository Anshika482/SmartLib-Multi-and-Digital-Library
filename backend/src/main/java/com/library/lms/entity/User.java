 * table that <b>already existed</b> and already holds rows. Every mapping below
 * was chosen to match the live {@code users} schema exactly, so Hibernate has
 * nothing to alter: same column names, same nullability, same lengths. Mapping
 * to existing data is the opposite exercise from designing a fresh table - the
 * database is the authority here, not the Java.</p>
 *
 * <p>The class is deliberately a plain entity for now. There is no repository,
 * service, controller or DTO, and no security layer - this step only teaches
 * JPA what the existing rows mean.</p>
